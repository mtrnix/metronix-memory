# KB Admin Console

The **KB Admin Console** is the open-source web UI for administering a Metronix Core
instance: connect data sources, register chat-bot channels, upload files, and watch the
health of the stack. It is a thin presentation layer — all logic and persistence live in
`metronix-core`, which the console reaches over the REST API.

The console is **optional**. The backend runs fully headless (MCP + REST); the console just
gives you a UI on top of it.

> **Scope:** this is the open-source admin console. The full operational **Control Center**
> (agent registry, workflow builder, memory inspector, FinOps, multi-team admin) is a separate
> product and is not part of this repository.

## What you can do here

- **Sources** — add, test, and sync **data connectors** (Jira, Confluence, GitHub, Google
  Drive, Notion, Slack) and **chat-bot channels** (Telegram, Discord, Slack), plus upload
  files for indexing.
- **Health & Stats** — service and database status (Postgres, Qdrant, Neo4j, Redis), workspace
  statistics, and live metrics.

## Prerequisites

- A running `metronix-core` instance on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (see the repo root
  [`install.md`](../install.md) to bring up the full stack).
- For local development: Node.js 20+.

## Run with Docker (recommended)

The console ships as an optional service behind the `kb` Docker Compose profile. From the
repo root:

```bash
docker compose --profile kb up -d --build
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**. The container is an nginx image that serves the built
SPA and proxies `/api`, `/health`, `/ready`, and `/metrics` to `metronix-core:8000`.

Override the published port with `KB_FRONTEND_PORT` (default `3000`):

```bash
KB_FRONTEND_PORT=3100 docker compose --profile kb up -d
```

## Run for development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # Vite dev server → http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

The dev server proxies `/api`, `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`,
so point it at a running backend.

Default development credentials: `admin@metronix.local` / `metronix`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build          # type-check + Vite production build → frontend/dist/
npm run preview        # serve the production build locally
npm run lint           # ESLint
```
